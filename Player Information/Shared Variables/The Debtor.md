### Need to know info

- Vaska can take many forms, though he/she often prefers to use a long ranged marksman rifle, with a distinct revolver magazine making him/her easy to spot in a tense situation, these rifles are exceptionally rare (with rumours stating that Vaska bough the entire inventory of them when they were first release)
