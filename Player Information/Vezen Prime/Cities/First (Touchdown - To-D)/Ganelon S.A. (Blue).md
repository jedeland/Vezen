> Ganelon is like that one company where it doesnt matter what planet you're on, you know you'll "always get ganelon", and maybe they cant stand up to the competition in all matters, but give them enough time and they'll find a way around it 

#Overview

Ganelon S.A. is the corporation that is a dependable product, galaxy wide. Most of their tools are made directly as reactions to their competitors with many products from other companies (e.g. Isten KF51 Armoured hover tank) having a direct "counter" (e.g. Ganelon S.A. Perun Lasercannon).
How can you tell its Ganelon? Well for one whoever you bought it from probably sold it to you legitimately and the company is known for treating its "own" well, unlike other companies this includes sub contractors, suppliers and even to an extent customers.

- If your spaceship drift engine breaks down and you call the customer service line, and someone picks up? yeh thats Ganelon
- Gun not working? You can buy an immediate drone diagnostic for 10 credits
- Is your body armour rated for combat in the vacuum of space, on the surface of a sun (Up to 9 Trillion Kelvin) and on the outskirts of a blackhole? yeh thats Ganelon

The focus on quality and care makes Ganelon products sought out by the risk adverse, and may people swear by the brand through thick and thin. The short fall is often that, cutting edge products or mass produced, cheaper alternatives always exist to undercut the S.A.
