#Overview

Akahige GmbH is the corporation that is almost 100% focused on developing new technologies to push human suffering (or joy depending on your sadism levels) to the maxiumum level possible, some ways you can identify Akahige are as follows
- Test subjects released into the general population to retrieve "genuine data"
- Research blacksites that look more like horror holo-novelle sets than labratories
- Distinct lack of respect for life (organic or synthetic)

The focus on technology also makes for an interesting product reputation, some consider their tools to be too high tech and prone to failures, while others covet the comforts of the most modern tools, the fastest spaceships, the most armoured mechs, the most devestating enchantments

#PlayerInteractions

Working for Akahige is a morally empty choice in almost all cases, and is illegal in most places 99% of the time. This factoid illustrates why they place so much focus on Vezen, testing a new bio-chemical weapon is of course evil, but who cares about a bunch of ex-cons and refugees getting affected

Possible Positive interactions:

- Getting paid to test new tools during questing
- Getting paid to retrieve study objects for R&D
- Trading high tech tooling for Firepower / Plausible Deniability
- Helping to develop new engineering or computing tools for personal use

Possible Negative interactions:

- Getting attacked for archeotech
- Getting bounties put out if you "take" one-of-a-kind items
- Akahige Hacker Subsidiary targeting your network actions
- Corporate sabotage
