To-D (Toad | Too doo | First) - Originally "Touchdown"

TLDR: "Well yeh I know the space elevator is there, and I know the university is there, and I know the streets are (relatively) safe-ish, but the club scene here is so pass√©"

- Generic SciFi City, lots of high concept tech and cutting edge scifi tools

## Culture: 

To-D is the "Typical" spacer city, one could be forgiven for thinking it was not an anarchist settlement on a forgotten rimworld, soaring white towers cover the centre of the town with many modern-esq buildings, primarily of glass, steel and white ceramic materials dot the outskirts of the city. The skyline however is dominated by the central artery of the city, the black; ever shifting space elevator that marks the true reason for this cities need for *some* stability. 

Roads, rail and spaceports are hidden away, only their end nodes and access points visible to the public. The people here are (relatively) happy and productive, but only if they are part of the wider cartel system that keeps To-D running. "PactPunk" is the everyday style here, and the structure of the city runs in a near feudal setting, with many guilds, "nobles" (read: cartel families) and religious functionaries found here

## Notable Jobs:

The massive logistical facilities attached to the space elevator all hang in a delicate balance, with many factions vying for a bigger cut of the pie, To-D is a more political and factional city than the others, though the old disused southwest side holds some secrets
- The enslaved AI known only as "Core" is always looking for new contractors, the central node is only interested in getting the space elevator running at 100%
	- There is talk that the outer nodes are less interested in the operation of the space elevator, and some are willing to pay big credits if you would break them free...
- The cartels and guilds are willing to pay big money for archeo tech from the northern wastes, and building new transport routes to the other cities
- The wider Net is relatively unknown here, but hackers, diplomats and bruisers that can expand each factions control over the physical and meta universes are always in demand
