### Local Organisations

##### The Modularists

The modularists are a post-biological group that has been studying Terminus for decades by now, in most respects they are a gang that terrorises travellers and extorts locals, yet all of their money is invested into researching and integrating archeotech into body mods for their higher ups

To describe them in a few words 

- If you are looking for expensive augmentations on the cheap, do them a favour
- If you have a distaste for synthetic life or post biological ideals, they arent for you
- If you are reasonably weak and ill armed, avoid the Modularists where possible, or pay their toll when demanded

##### The Guardians

The guardians are a rather large group of people that try to bring a semblance of justice to vezen, although they exist in other cities Terminus is their main head quarters. Most guardians take on the role of police officer or bounty hunter, they will do what they can to help, but dont expect them to start **heat** with the other big factions

To describe them shortly

- If you have lost something, or it was taken by a petty criminal, call a guardian via your comm device
- If you are an out of towner and need a reliable bodyguard, guardians are often just a call away
- Some might see them as just another gang, as their good deeds are often implicitly rewarded on vezen with a material gift / donation

##### The Engineers

The engineers are the fingers of Terminus' AI core, they do what the AI often forgets to do or deems unimportant, they are easily identifiable by their uniform items, all members of the core are given replicated items fitting their rank, the technology to do this is unfathomably complex and many wonder just how far this can go

Small rumours about the engineers

- The leading council is said to be equipped with some incredible magical items, even more interesting is that these magical items seem to be copies of one another, insinuating that Terminus can produce relics on command when it desires
- The lower tier engineers are well respected in the community, even though their menial jobs would be seen as "unskilled labour" in other star systems
- The engineers are the only faction that can build out new parts of the city of terminus, the way this is done is shrouded in secrecy and is considered a great mystery as the city is ever expanding internally, but the ships frame remains unchanged
