Vezen prime, "Not great, not terrible" is how most people would sum up the dying planet filled with criminals, refugees and all other "undesirables" that the galactic core cant be bothered to deal with (~~As long as you stay in the cities, that is~~). 

Vezen is your end destination, a [[Old Friend|common friend]] of yours has died recently, his final request (a rather simple one), find his daughter and deliver to her the family heirloom (an old necklace, from before the *wipe*)

What can one expect on Vezen prime?
- All people here are fleeing something, civilization is mostly located around the polar south of the planet, which is much more arable and hospitable
	- The type of thing they are fleeing and why will have a considerable influence on how they treat you and your fellow denizens of Vezen
- The north of the planet is a treasure trove of relics, with many hypotheses as to where they come from
	- Corporations are stated to be searching for long lost research centre's, sending their goons to look for bygone technologies, or illegal experiments that would cut their future profit margins
	- There are rumours about that the Vesk noble class created and hid vast armouries and war bond assets in the growing sands
	- Rumours slither and slide that the deserts were created as a curse from the gods, to flood the once prosperous (AND RICH) cities of the north
- Authority here is split into 3 sub groups
	- Influence: How many factions would care if someone messed around with you
	- Power: The risk reward analysis for all predatory actions, if you look strong enough those bandits might just leave you (and your compatriots) alone
	- Trust: Certain regions and factions pride themselves on being entrusted "safe zones"
