Vezen prime, "Not great, not terrible" is how most people would sum up the dying planet filled with criminals, refugees and all other "undesirables" that the galactic core cant be bothered to deal with (~~As long as you stay in the cities, that is~~). Vezen is your end destination, a common friend of yours has died recently, his final request (a rather simple one), find his daughter and deliver to her the family heirloom (an old necklace, from before the *wipe*)

What can one expect on Vezen prime?
- All people here are fleeing something, civilization is mostly located around the polar south of the planet, which is much more arable and hospitable
- The north of the planet is a treasure trove of relics, with many hypotheses as to where they come from
	- Corporations are stated to be searching for long lost research centers, sending their goons to look for bygone technologies, or illegal experiments that would cut their future profit margins
	- There are rumours about that the Vesk noble class created and hid vast armouries and war bond assets in the growing sands
